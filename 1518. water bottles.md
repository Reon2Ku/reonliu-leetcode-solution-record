# 1518. water bottles

## question

There are `numBottles` water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`, return *the **maximum** number of water bottles you can drink*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_2_1875.png)

```
Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= numBottles <= 100`
- `2 <= numExchange <= 100`



## solution

初见解，但是exchange用了额外的内存开销，尝试进行内存优化

~~~
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int result = numBottles;
        while(numBottles>=numExchange)
        {
            int exchange = numBottles/numExchange;
            numBottles = numBottles%numExchange + exchange;
            result+=exchange;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
~~~

第二解：时间空间均击败100%

~~~
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int result = numBottles;
        while(numBottles>=numExchange)
        {
            //int exchange = numBottles/numExchange;
            result+=numBottles/numExchange;
            numBottles =  numBottles/numExchange + numBottles%numExchange;
            
        }
        return result;
    }
};
