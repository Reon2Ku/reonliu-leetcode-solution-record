# 89.Gray code

## question

An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

- Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2n - 1]`,
- The first integer is `0`,
- An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**, and
- The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return *any valid **n-bit gray code sequence***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 16`



## solution

虽然是自己写的但是感觉解法好神秘啊哈哈哈，你下次再来估计都看不懂自己在干嘛

~~~
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> grayVec(1,0);
        int count = n;
        while(--count)
        {
            grayVec.insert(grayVec.end(),grayVec.begin(),grayVec.end());
            grayVec[grayVec.size()-2] = count;
        }
        grayVec.insert(grayVec.end(),grayVec.begin(),grayVec.end());
        // for(int i:grayVec)
        // {
        //     cout<<i<<endl;
        // }
        int curr = 1<<(n-1);
        vector<int> result;
        for(int i=0;i<pow(2,n);i++)
        {
            curr ^= 1<<(grayVec[i]);
            result.push_back(curr);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
